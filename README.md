# integrating-vuejs-in-multipage-applications
Smooth integration of Vue js in multi-page applications which might have used Vanilla JS or Jquery earlier


## Why use Vue in place of Vanilla JS ?

- Simplifies stuff like event handling, data handling, API calls and more
- Routing can be implemented on the front-end
- Component based structure encourages modularity in user interface development.
- Saves lines of code
