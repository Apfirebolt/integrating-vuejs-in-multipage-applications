# integrating-vuejs-in-multipage-applications
Smooth integration of Vue js in multi-page applications which might have used Vanilla JS or Jquery earlier


## Why use Vue in place of Vanilla JS ?

- Simplifies stuff like event handling, data handling, API calls and more
- Routing can be implemented on the front-end
- Component based structure encourages modularity in user interface development.
- Saves lines of code

## Data, Events and Filters

The about.html page contains examples for event handling through Vue. The section tag is wrapped with a Vue object so that event and data handling can be done through Vue instead of pure Vanilla JS.

Filtering is demonstrated using currency where $ sign is appended before each currency value in the currency array.
